== Getting Started
Let's get started by pulling in all the imports needed in the examples below:

[source,{example-source-lang}]
----
include::{example-source}[tag=imports]
----

Then we connect to a Couchbase cluster, as usual (of course, change the address and credentials to match your own cluster's):

[source,{example-source-lang}]
----
include::{example-source}[tag=cluster]
----

The examples below will use the travel-sample example bucket.  This can be installed through the Couchbase Admin UI in Settings -> Sample Buckets.

In order to be able to use query on a bucket, it must have at least a primary index created.  The easiest way to create this is
through the Couchbase Admin UI.  Simply visit the Query tab then write this in the Query Editor and hit Execute:

[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE PRIMARY INDEX ON `travel-sample`
----
